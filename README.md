# SkinCancerDetection

This project introduce a way of detecting two types of skin cancer. The dataset is taken from the ISIC (International Skin Image Collaboration) Archive. It consists of 1800 pictures of benign moles and 1497 pictures of malignant classified moles. The pictures have all been resized to low resolution (224x224x3) RGB. The task of this kernel is to create a model, which can classify a mole visually into benign and malignant.
